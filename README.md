# TabletopHelper
These are some of my code that I use to automate some of my tabletop games. They are unorginized, designed solely fÄ±r my usage and modified according to my house rules. But if you can find a usage for them, go ahead.
## helperBasic.py
This one includes different type of randomization and calculation capabilities that I use in nearly all other scripts.
## helperPokeItem.py
This one allows me to roll random items while running PTA (Pokemon Tabletop Adventures) Sun & Moon Update as well as the pickup ability.
## helperPokemon.py
This one includes my random encounter tables for my current PTA game, if you are one of my players, you are not allowed to look into this.
